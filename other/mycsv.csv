0,0.0,My mother told me about this movie years ago and after much searching we finally found it on VHS After watching it I realized why it had impressed itself on her so the Messiah as portrayed by Bruce Marchiano is a virile passionate affectionate emotional man completely human and completely aware of his existence as the son of God Told word for word from the book of Matthew my only complaint is that the correct name Yahshua wasn t used instead of Jesus something I never expected in the first place br br This movie is compelling very well acted and with beautiful shots of both scenery and people at their most true to life Especially poignant to watch during the Passover season this movie is well worth any price and I ve bought it over and over to give to friends and acquaintances once I found it on DVD br br Buy it you won t be sorry ,,
1,0.0,I have always been a fan of Matthew Perry enjoying his great comedic timing But Fools Rush In has always been a favorite of mine because it displays his tender side as well br br Alex played by Matthew Perry meets Isabel Salma Hayek and have a one night stand She disappears but returns 3 months later to announce that she is pregnant with his child What transcends from here on end is an over night wedding and a marriage which puts to the test their individual heritage The challenges are many but they each attempt to rise to the occasion as Isabel nears the birth of their child br br I would especially recommend this to any couple who come from different backgrounds It will touch your heart ,,
2,0.0,This is an absolutely saccharine vapid funny story with a great hook A divorced daddy lawyer has his life turned upside down when his disappointed kid Dad missed another birthday party gets his birthday wish that his dad could only tell the truth just for one day br br In the first place no kid would say Just for one day he d say Forever Be that as it may the comic possibilities are quite promising with the manic Jim Carrey in the role of the lying daddy But ultimately this film very much reminds me of Robin Williams s breakthrough role as Mork in the TV series Mork Mindy which unfortunately is now rarely seen in spite of the huge number of cable channels available In each LL and M M we have an extremely thin poorly executed backdrop behind a very energetic comedian at his best This makes for lots of laughs but nothing memorable Junk food comedy worth renting but only worth buying for the Carrey faithful br br Liar Liar is very much worth watching for the laughs and there are plenty The biggest one may be in the bloopers during the end credits when Swoosie Kurtz zings Carrey beautifully in a way that shows to no one s surprise that everybody in on the making of this quickie was completely devoid of illusions about the nature of the film It s a cute flick but one that could have been a far better movie if someone had been willing to make it so As it is it s at least good for a few laughs but even a few of the comedy bits are remarkably forced ,,
3,0.0,This was my favorite movie when I was in Middle School It still is a great movie I was glad to wait for the special edition dvd When I was younger I was interested in becoming a storm chaser so this was quite a film Now that I am older I think there are still some flaws with the movie but that is ok The movie was made for fun not for great writing Some of the words storm chasers use people would not be familiar with but I suggest people who want to learn more about weather go to the library Anyway if you are looking for a film with great special effects this is the one ,,
4,0.0,For women of all ages but most certainly for middle aged and above who have been or are married You know when you re reading a good book or talking to a good friend and they just get everything you re feeling There s hardly a better moment than that Shirley Valentine is a keeper movie to pass among female friends and family Men can watch of course but they re not likely to get it Love it love it love it ,,

7,1.0,I saw the original miniseries on t v It was quite good However the vhs tape I recieved thru amazon com was cut by 50 or more which totally ruined it To anyone viewing it for the first time it wouldn t make any sense The continuity is so chopped up all we re left with is a collection of seemingly unrelated events The scenes that were left out connect everything together and also were very interesting as well I don t like anybody deciding what is enough for me to see Especially at 19 95 a crack plus shipping,,
8,0.0,I somehow don t think even getting on the ground and bowing down to the pure unadulterated genius of Kevin Smith would be enough in the way of thanking him for this movie To say it is funny would be a huge understatement to say it is you me and that guy you know the one the one who is always lurking would be more to the point Its a movie about life and when one has a few moments to step back and really look at what we are doing saying where we are going and how we are getting there you can really see the utter humor of it all I m not even supposed to be here today is was the moniker of us all at one point or another in our lives and this movie is about those funny odd trying to act grownup moments we have all had ENJOY I know you will br br Most Happy br br Lady Anne br ,,
9,0.0,This is an incredible serious and beautiful film The imagery is astounding and often thought provoking The music is also great and matches the film very well if you like Peter Gabriel s Passion the instrumental soundtrack to The Last Temptation of Christ you will like the score for Baraka p I disagree with the reviewer who said that Baraka is just an imitation of Koyaanisqatsi If you d bother to read the credits Ron Fricke the creator of Baraka was also responsible for ALL of the filming for the qatsi trilogy which includes Koyaanisqatsi Baraka is a different kind of movie with a different more subtly communicated message p Baraka was shot in the very expensive 70mm format which yields a very high quality picture especially when transferred to DVD Ron Fricke is a master of the 70mm format and he actually designed many of the camera rigs used in Baraka including the very high quality time lapse footage Give Fricke some credit for having learned something in the almost 10 years since Koyaanisqatsi was filmed p If you are expecting vapid New Age eye candy this is not the movie for you If you want a beautiful film that will change you a film that you can watch again every 6 months without getting tired of it then buy this DVD I have the original DVD very hapy with it so I can t say whether the film transfer quality in the Collector s Edition is on par Maybe one of these days I ll buy the Collector s Edition and see which one I like best ,,
10,0.0,Well the cover was dented in when I recieved it wasn t very impressed since I was looking forward to recieving this dvd dvd works fine though so besides the massive dent in the cover its good It was cheap so I guess it boils down to you pay for what you get ,,

12,0.0,For the first four fifths of this movie it was one of the creepiest scariest films I ve ever seen A souffle of understated horror acted to perfection by Bob Hoskins and Elaine Cassidy But then plop the souffle falls in The screenwriter simply could not think of a way to end the film He set it up for the first four fifths and then cliches upon cliches Doesn t any director read the entire script before starting the filming Or do they just read up to 80 and then want to be surprised by whatever ending the actors come up with Why do I give this film as many as three stars Because it was so well done for a while Not even a drop of blood No corpses No maiming It delivers the horror by the sheer cinematography and understatement Bottom line strictly for moviegoers who want to see good horror film making technique but stay away if you don t like to be disappointed by the plot ,,

14,2845,positive,0.0,A globetrotting Fed Ex employee named Chuck Tom Hanks after kissing his sweetheart Kelly Helen Hunt goodbye at the airport hops onto a Fed Ex plane that eventually runs into major trouble during a fierce storm and plummets into the sea The plane s crew all perish but Chuck is miraculously washed ashore on a deserted island where he must fend for himself using only the island s elements at his disposal as well as some Fed Ex packages that wash ashore from the plane wreckage p Remember the great sci fi cult classic from the early 60 s quot Robinson Crusoe On Mars quot about a U S astronaut stranded all alone on the red planet quot Cast Away quot seems to borrow somewhat from this film with a few changes Instead of futuristic gadgets to work with our hero has Fed Ex packages Instead of an adorable wooly monkey amp an alien slave for company our stranded protagonist has a volleyball that he draws a face on names it Wilson get it and talks to it Personally I ll give quot Cast Away quot credit where credit is due despite being a disjointed film it is Tom Hanks terrific performance as Chuck that makes quot Cast Away quot the absorbing film that it is p For the big middle section of quot Cast Away quot the movie is basically The Tom Hanks Show he s all that we see for the large second act of the film which spans four years There s lots of quiet time in this part of the film too Hanks doesn t speak very much at least not at first as he struggles to survive on the island And yet as he goes from being washed ashore to scouting out the island to collecting the packages that wash up on the beach to figuring out how to make fire and get food to talking to his volleyball chum Wilson etc Hanks remains very compelling in the role of Chuck throughout With any other actor in the role this film could ve been a major snoozefest But with Hanks at it s center you remain absorbed in his adventure and needless to say Hanks has got another well deserved Oscar nomination headed his way with this one And kudos to director Robert Zemeckis for his skillful direction of his star as well as his incredible photography p If quot Cast Away quot has any faults it s that the film is a bit disjointed in it s storytelling and the final portion of the film goes on a little too long Unfortunately I can t go into any of this without heading into spoiler territory But in the end what it all comes down to is this your enjoyment of quot Cast Away quot primarily depends on whether or not you care about Tom Hanks Fed Ex man and what happens to him Me I DID care about this guy and what happens to him Therefore despite being imperfect quot Cast Away quot still gets a solid recommendation from me It s Tom s show all the way and it s a good one 
15,1.0,During the 90 s the creators of the action genre sat in a boardroom and kicked some ideas around on how to spice up the film industry With films the Death Ring dominating the market something new had to be done Through months of deliberation they finally agreed upon the ultimate concept of joining man and beast together to take on a deadly crime syndicate The first shot was Turner in Hooch with Tom Hanks followed by a slightly more entertaining James Belushi attempt called K 9 At this time Chuck Norris was at home trimming him mustache with a pair of hedge clippers when he thought I could beat the tar out of Hanks and Belushi with both hands tied behind my mullet so where s my cop dog movies He then roundhouse kicked his way into a star role in Top Dog which he d so sorely regret about a week into shooting br br Top Dog starts off with some hilariously bad acted white white supremacist as they plan to blow up San Diego Why are they doing this We haven t the slightest idea Maybe it s because they didn t legalize the good stuff in that region yet and the Nazi s couldn t take it anymore Whatever the case may be super rouge cop Jake Wilder get s called upon for the case and is teamed up with a dog who may have been responsible for writing the script as far as we re concerned The dialogue and one liner dog jokes are something we d hope to never experience again and thank the movie world for not producing a sequel It s just awful and this is coming from a couple of the biggest Chuck enthusiasts out there The only thing that would have saved the movie is if Norris and the dog had an action packed battle to the death similar to the end brawl in Missing in Action II Obviously we did not get this one and in no way can recommend it to even the b lovers out there ,,
16,0.0,After a 6 year hiatus the James Bond franchise was brought back to life by dirctor Martin Campbell The Mask of Zorro With Pierce Brosnan as the new Bond the series was given a new harder edge with great action stunts and cool cars Sean Bean is great as Alex Trevalyn a former agent 006 turned enemy and Famke Janssen is the movie s female villianess Judi Dench is brought in as the new M along with Samantha Bond as Moneypenny p Brosnan is superb as the charming vodka martini drinking Bond with witty lines and he takes the character away from the coldness of Timothy Dalton The action ante is upped considerably from the lacklustre Licence to Kill 1989 with some great set pieces including tanks trains and of course big bangs It is a Bond film after all and the action is riddled with witty one liners Add a stomping title track from Tina Turner sharp editing courtesy of Terry Rawlings and Desmond Llewelyn as Q who has starred in every Bond film except Dr NO 1962 and Live and Let Die 1973 Arguably the best bond film it is most certainly the biggest ,,
17,0.0,I had forgotten how much I enjoyed quot Speed quot until I saw it again in its newest DVD transfer Forget about the plausibility of the plot since if that were the standard to judge action adventure movies how many would qualify Instead enjoy the non stop excitement with quot Armaggedon quot type pacing where each solution is followed by another problem p The movie is basically all action all the time and that s what those of us who love this genre want If you re looking for profound dialogue or character development you won t find it but you will find lots of humor thrown in to lighten things up p Keanu Reeves gives a glimpse of the sort of intensity that he would bring to the quot Matrix quot and Bullock is about as believable as anyone could be behind the wheel of the bus The two of them establish a good chemistry and this definitely lifts the film above the run of the mill p Dennis Hopper is his usual maniacal self as the crazed villain and Jeff Daniels does a credible job as Reeves partner the two of them had some great lines at the beginning of the film p The DVD transfer is excellent the video is clear and well balanced with minimal digital artifacts and the audio will give your surround system a real workout I haven t looked at the second disc yet but it s loaded with extras p Bottom line for a classic adventure flick with an outstanding new remastering this Five Star version of quot Speed quot can t be beat ,,

20,0.0,Recently I was able to catch Spielberg s The Lost World I say Spielberg because other than the title it bears no resemblance to the book This is not necessarily a bad thing While a lousy interpretation of the book it is still a good film p Jeff Goldblum is hired by a man who is dead in the book to study the ecosystems on InGen s Site B where dinosaurs have been flourishing Only the fact that his girlfriend is in danger gets Goldblum to go No sooner does he arrive and try and convince her to leave than a massive InGen expedition shows up to hunt and capture dinosaurs p InGen s plans for capturing dinosaurs goes awry when Goldblum and friends release the dinosaurs during a satellite linked board meeting InGen plans to open a dinosaur park facility at the San Diego zoo During the chaos every radio in the camp manages to get trampled The survivors must now find a way off of the island Unfortunately most of them are killed in a brief attack by velociraptors while in tall grass p The few survivors of the second expedition manage to capture a T Rex and ready it for shipping to the states Goldblum and friends escape by helicopter p In San Diego the T Rex manages to escape and go rampaging through the city Goldblum must lure the T Rex back onto the freighter that brought it to the States In the end a huge navy escort follows the freighter back to the island while Mr Hammond implores to public to leave the dinosaurs alone they deserve it p Some people definitely had fun making this movie There were scenes from classic and not so classic movies including King Kong Godzilla Carnosaur 3 CARNOSAUR was the book Crichton got the idea for JURASSIC PARK from and others Two scenes I particularly enjoyed were a crowd of screaming Japanese looking over their shoulders while running in terror and a little boy who wakes his parents to tell them that there is a dinosaur in the back yard p It was reported that a paleontologist made sure that the dinosaurs acted as current scientific beliefs say they should Hah The Stegosaurs were the size of apatosaurs Something possibly the escaped triceratops managed to knock a hummer airborne so that ir reached an altitude of at least a hundred feet and an amazing distance Velociraptors can now leap three stories up and forty yards out The tyrannosaur can run right through building walls without slowing down Fun Yes Realistic No way Needless to say if the dinosaurs acted this way in the first movie then no one would have escaped p Still it was a very fun film that I recommend to any dinosaur lover who can stand to see people pulled apart by huge carnivores sharing a tidbit The Lost World the third film by that name should be available on video and day now ,,

22,0.0,The Day the Earth Caught Fire 1962 has impressive credentials given that it was co written and directed by Val Guest the man who brought to the screen such classic films as The Quatermass Xperiment 1955 and The Abominable Snowman 1957 p Peter Stenning Edward Judd is a down on his luck newspaper man struggling with the difficulties of his recent divorce maintaining a relationship with his young son and taking up the drink a bit more often than he probably should all having a negative effect on his once upwardly mobile career and his life in general To top things off London begins suffering a heat wave like it s rarely seen before Not only that but it seems all around the world strange phenomena has been occurring from flooding earthquakes drought freak snowstorms typhoons etc All coming on the heels of news that within the past week the Soviets and the Americans both detonated atomic devices larger than had ever been seen before p Leo McKern plays Bill Maguire an associate and close friend at the newspaper where Peter works and begins to develop a theory about what s going on but is not able to confirm anything as the government has kept a tight lid on what it knows handing out canned responses to an ever questioning press and public Peter while trying to squeeze some information out of a government office meets Jeannie Craig Janet Munro a worker within the office who sometimes operates the switchboard receiving calls Peter starts putting the moves on her but she isn t very responsive at first p Soon the temperature starts rising lakes and rivers start drying up and government enforced water rationing measures are put into effect Facts about the current condition are sketchy as the government is still not very forthcoming but Jeannie overhears some startling information she is hesitant to share but is unable to keep it to herself She shares it with Peter after making him promise that it would only be between them to which quickly releases the information to his newspaper One may think Peter quite the cad but given the enormity of the information he really had no choice Jeannie finds herself in hot water as she is discovered as the leak and Peter finds himself on the outs with Jeannie for the betrayal What was this startling information What is the government hiding What s causing the all the natural catastrophes It s not too difficult to figure out but the film does offer a few surprises you may not see coming p Despite the low budget director Guest does an amazing job creating a world on the verge of an apocalyptic nightmare The focus on the newspaper and its staff working feverishly to uncover facts and report accurately while the world is falling apart around their ears gave a unique view into the genre The main characters in the film were nicely developed but not always likeable adding a realistic sense Also the documentarian style used in many of the scenes served nicely to give the viewer more of a sense of dread as if this was something that could really happen or was really happening Shot primarily in black and white there are a number of scenes at the beginning and the end in color but use an orangish gel to create a creepy and oppressive effect The effects are decent but are used in a complementary effect taking a back seat to the substantial intelligent sparkling and well thought out plot p The wide screen print provided by Anchor Bay Entertainment looks beautiful and the audio is quite good The listing of features on this site claims a full screen format is available here too but I didn t see it Special features include a commentary by director Val Guest and journalist Ted Newsom TV spots a theatrical trailer radio spots a still gallery with a couple of pretty racy photos of Janet Munro and a biography of director Val Guest If you re looking for big bang effects to cover an inconsequential plot like the more recent films Independence Day 1996 or The Core 2003 then you ll be disappointed here If you re looking for an effective thought provoking science fiction thriller with lots of meat and little filler then this is a great choice p Cookieman108,,
23,0.0,Kubrick s Spartacus is one of many epic movies of its time With the grandiose settings Kubrick recreates the vastness of Rome However that is only one significance of this movie because it is really about Kirk Douglas s character Spartacus Spartacus is a slave among many slaves Enslaved around the young age of 13 this life in chains is about all he knows That is until at a gladiatorial training camp Spartacus becomes the unlikely hero and starts a slave revolt at the camp It is Spartacus s cool head and clear thinking that makes him the leader of the slaves yet he is a humble sort just like Mel Gibson in Braveheart just trying to be free br br Epic movies were made around this type of character such as Braveheart Dr Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia Therefore it is only natural that this story be told because it is different than Ben Hur The movie goes along like almost any epic a spattering of action with peaceful interludes of thinking and conversation This movie is not more spectacular than all the other movies of its type In fact it is rather plain as it allows you to fall into the character s minds and hearts but does not force you This movie is only so gripping like that song you play for dinner party atmosphere but nothing else One thing is for sure though Kubrick did a good job at making the movie at all especially at such a young age However I feel that the best rating out of five whole stars which I can deem it is a three star rating ,,
24,0.0,There are plenty of reviews regarding the movie but not much has been said about the THX Optimizer The Optimizer seems to have been beefed up from previous Pixar DVD releases It s not as exhaustive as something like Digital Video Essentials but it provides many of the same tests and is easier to use and understand If you re looking for a simple video optimizer buy this DVD and get a great movie too ,,
25,0.0,It took me much to long to see A Clockwork Orange but when I finally did I understood what all of the rave reviews were about Nothing quite like this movie has been done since and there are so many things to watch on screen that it takes a few viewings to really see it all The look and feel of this movie is unlike any other The use of music in this film is something you would not think offhand to fit a movie such as this but it really works This is a film that still does not feel dated even up to this day Interesting strange fantastic and imaginative ,,
26,0.0,This was truly a wonderful film The storyline was everything you could want in one Fantasy in its most stunning form was presented here There were some unneeded parts like the quot bedroom quot scenes but other than that this film was amazing ,,
27,0.0,Let me apologize first by stating that I am one of those people that wants there to be resolution at the end of a movie I want to know what the hell is going on and why There is one exception to that and that would be Blair Witch Project Unfortunately this movie does not supply me with any useful information about what and why everything is happening I also want a movie to deliver when it claims to have the scariest opening sequence and the gutsiest ending This movie does not deliver on either one of those claims If simply leaving the movie unfinished and open at the end is gutsy then I say NO to gutsy endings And if a movie does not have an opening sequence scarier than Scream or doesnt even come close then dont make the claim that it is the scariest On the other hand this movie had so much promise it did have me scared it did have me nervous and on the edge of my seat That is until the ending came I was so furious and angry that it made me hate the movie Also there was really nothing that frightening about the monster If they wanted to leave something to the imagination they should have let us imagine him My own image would have been far more frightening than him it or whatever it is And what the hell is it anyway Not knowing what it is or what and why it is doing evil things does not scare me it only aggravates me and ticks me off Loose ends just dont work and only make it seem that the person directing or producing is just sequel hungry Ugh Well that s what I think and feel about this movie that had such promise and no delivery of the goods that we so desperately seek in horror scary movies But I guess once one has seen Scream all others pale in comparison Scream is a hard act to follow and I am sure everyone knows this br Thanks for taking the time to read my ranting and raving ,,
28,0.0,I rented this movie about 18 months ago not knowing what to expect I d heard of KIDS but just assumed this movie would be a tepid effort How wrong i was It s not often that movies hit me in the gut and leave me stunned but i can t explain this film any other way than to say it is sheer genius Larry Clark has the style of a true master film maker The performances from this young cast are simply brilliant He is a director who lets the camera focus on the eyes of the actors so you feel what they feel His camera lingers imperceptibly for a fraction of a second longer than is comfortable His visual style is unique his choice of music inspired and most of all the acting is just out of this world I ve seen some of these actors since in movies that are quite average so it leads me to believe it really is the director who elicits the performances from them Larry Clark is a master film maker albeit a pervert however I recall Roger Ebert saying if a 25 year old made this film it would be considered cutting edge and a brilliant look into the world of troubled adolescents or words to that effect Larry Clark is what i want to become A 50 year old who is still cool enough to know what kids get up to he likes to explore the dirty side of life and show the things that we all do in private but not many of us want to admit to he truly is a visionary His films may not be for everyone but they certainly do not insult your intelligence THE BEST FILM I HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST 5 YEARS ,,

31,1.0,Words cannot express how disappointed I am by the quality of this tape Expecting the wonderful movie that so many know and love I purchased this video only to discover on the back of the video sleeve that this is an edited version of the original That s fine but what these people did is unacceptable They deleted all the original music including background music plus they deleted voices and background sounds and replaced them I could not even recognize John Wayne s drawl I don t think it s even his voice and Maureen O Hara s brogue has been replaced with the voice of someone else On top of that the timing is way off I ended up turning the sound off and watching the movie in silence Still a wonderful view but for someone who went so far as to name her daughter quot Kathryn quot after the spirited character O Hara plays I am thoroughly disgusted This change should be noted in the description for those of us who care about quality ,,

33,0.0,I really like this film and would try watching more movies if I thought they d be as good as this one I have watched this at least three times and enjoyed it every time I think it is the characters perhaps the actors that I fiud so enjoyable The film isn t terribly frightening but who needs that This is a ghost movie in the old style much like the Sixth Sense or The Others Probably the reason it gets mixed reviews is that people who expect a military action thriller are dissappointed with a ghost story and people who want a pure ghost story are dissappointed with the military action I found the combination much to my liking ,,
34,0.0,This is from legendary and thankfully very prolific Japanese born film maker Takashi Miike and was part of his Triad trilogy which also included Shinjuku Triad Society and Ley Lines This one tells the story of a down at heels Yakuza who has found himself stranded in Taiwan having been abandoned by his Big Brother and hence is now persona non grata back at home Yuuji Sho Ikawa Gozy and Dead or Alive lives in a shanty hovel and has to make ends meet by doing bargain hit man jobs for a local Triad crime boss Mr Kes who is about as likable as a dose of the clap He is also being continually promised that he will get a forged passport so he can get out of the hole he has found himself in but this is used as a carrot to keep him working br br Then a woman turns up and dumps a mute boy on his door step saying that this is your father she has puit up with him long enough and now the father can deal with it Yuuji in unmoved and unconcerned as he can not even remember the woman s name As he has another job to do the kid starts to tag along As Yuuji has a fear of doing jobs in the rain he ends up waiting out the storm in a brothel where he makes a connection with one of the pros His next job then presents him with an opportunity to change everything br br This is one of the more paced of Miike s films it does have some gangster violence but instead dwells much more on the inter play between the main three characters and the almost familial bond that is allowed to burgeon It has a poetic quality that is set against a plot so bleak that it is almost Dickensian the boy is particularly good at carrying out a role with absolutely no dialogue yet you get to understand him perfectly The constant rain is used as a metaphor for the crappiness of their existence and the longing for some sun much like living in England at the moment br br This is a thoughtful well directed and shot film that really demonstrates the breadth and diversity of Miike Ichi The Killer this most certainly is not I found it totally engrossing and am slowly working my way through his back catalogue In Japanese and Mandarin this is for fans of Asian cinema who like their flms a little bit more subtle and ones that do not pull their punches but still has a few ,,
35,0.0,Every professional review said this movie was a disappointment Just goes to show you that professional reviews aren t always right p This movie was funny well acted and well timed Many good lines the addition of Cathy Moriarty Gentile I know the Gentiles to the cast made the movie better and she and DiNrio interact great p The return of Vitti to the street and the inclusion of his crew in a Mafia TV show are very funny The Chinese restaurant scene was great but from the outtakes at the end would have been even better if some of the cut scenes were included p The ending is a little abrupt It would have cost the movie 1 2 a star but the quality of the action and the actors keep it going p A toss up ,,

37,0.0,With great performances by Charles Boyer Oscar Winner Ingrid Bergman and Joseph Cotten Gaslight is one of the best thrillers of the 40 s and indeed of all time It proves to us that there is more than meets the eye when it comes to people but also to any other situation It also asks us if we know the ones we trust Some plot spoilers p The story is of a married couple Paula Bergman and Gregory Anton Boyer Paula s aunt a famous performer named Alice Alquiest was murdered ten years before in her house while Paula was there Now her and Gregory have come to live in that same house in Thornton square Whenever Gregory goes to work on evenings Paula begins to hear sound up in the attic and the gas always goes down Though he does some suspicious acts she doesn t suspect that Gregory is obsessed with locating her aunt s jewels But Gregory convinces Paula that she is ill and devises a plan to systematically drive her mad Only when a Scotland Yard Inspector Cotten reopens the Alquiest case does the truth unravel But will Paula still keep her sanity p In addition to the three leads there is also supporting work from Dame May Whitty Barbara Everest and Angela Lansbury in her screen debut The cinematography is also very well done and allows us to venture into Paula s isolation and heightens the mood and suspense The art direction also won an Oscar and Boyer was nominated for his despicable character Boyer never strikes Bergman throughout the whole movie yet is able to dominate her by using strong forceful words p Multiple viewings don t cause the movie to age Rather they strengthen it Do yourself a favor and rent this tonight ,,
38,1.0,The movie was sort of interesting with a lot of little plot twists until it was about three quartes through Then it got really stupid contrived and of course politically correct Jodie Foster does a number of really stupid and non realistic things like not telling the police there s a problem Afterall the thugs holding her daughter can t hear what she s saying And then not taking the damn gun herself and shooting Finally if I see one more quot dead man rising back to life quot in any movie I think I will throw up Raoul who already has a bashed arm and is bleeding quite badly is smashed over the head with a sledge hammer That would be enough to do any mortal in But no he pops up back to life full of vim and vigor well I wish they might have put a realistic ending on it ,,
39,0.0,I love this film It took me a while to get into because of all the 1950s opera singing but the acting and cast are great I love Dorothy Dandridge who was beautiful both inside and out Anyone interested in Dorothy Dandridge during her finest hour should pick up this film ,,
40,0.0,The Bottom Line br br A weighty somewhat self important adaptation of an acclaimed novel The English Patient along with other movies that fit that description like Sophie s Choice and Cold Mountain was pure Oscar bait but it s also a suitably epic romance that will no doubt appeal to those who like this sort of thing ,,

42,0.0,Dawn of the Dead Zack Snyder 2004 br br The first thing to know about the remake Dawn of the Dead and you should know this before you go in is that the only was a fan of the original is going to enjoy the remake is if you consider it as a completely separate film The basic premise is here small core of survivors shopping mall but the execution is completely different br br The new Dawn fits into the new fast zombie craze Resident Evil House of the Dead 28 Days Later etc You start off with a nurse Sarah Polley from Go getting off at the end of a very busy day She goes home goes to sleep after some gratuitous shower sex with the husband they wake up the next morning and their neighbor has turned into a zombie Uh oh But not the shambling mound from a Romero movie a zipping horror that can be across the room and latched onto your throat before you can say go rollerblade somewhere else willya br br The nurse hooks up with a cop Pulp Fiction Holiday Heart s lovely Ving Rhames the two of them hook up with three other survivors the pragmatic type who still wants to save the world Jake Weber Wendigo The Cell and the young lovestruck pregnant couple who just want to live long enough to have the baby Mekhi Phifer recently of 8 Mile and ER br br You can already see the difference more survivors and thus more potential zombie food But what the movie gives us in expansiveness it sacrifices in content where the longer slower original film focused on creating wonderfully complex characters the new version is concerned with giving you blood and bodies And lots of both br br Which may be perhaps the only interesting comparison between the two Romero s original has less blood less gore and by far a lower body count than does the remake It got slapped with an X this gets an R Perhaps it s time to re release the originals to get the funding for Twilight of the Dead One can only hope br br If you look at the new Dawn of the Dead as just another fast zombie flick you re probably going to enjoy it As long as that is you liked Resident Evil and 28 Days Later and didn t think House of the Dead was too terribly awful Get ready for an awful lot of jumps some groanworthy humor especially of the sick variety and a soundtrack that veers from unlistenable to downright insane Richard Cheese s lounge version of Disturbed s The Sickness Turn your brain off you ll have a blast It s only when you reflect on how much the original pressured you to turn on your brain that you start wondering why they felt the need to make this in the first place ,,

44,0.0,Seeing Spaceballs after the passing of some twenty years is a vastly different experience than seeing it in the theatre was all those years ago After spoofing the western the horror genre and silent film Brooks set his sights on spoofing the big science fiction adventure with somewhat mixed results br br Spaceballs is essentially a space fairy tale and plays best when viewed as such Brooks says in his commentary track that the film plays its best to a children s audience who have made it a cult favorite The plot is simple enough The citizen s of Planet Spaceball are running out of air In order to remedy this problem they decide to kidnap the Druidish princess and hold her hostage in order to get the combination to her planet s airshield What follows is a parody of Star Wars played against a movie marketing blitz The results are mixed and a little dated but the humor works br br The Collector s Edition features a commentary track three featurettes including a memorial to John Candy and an assortment of trailers galleries and small features that make this a fun watch While not the greatest of Brooks film this one is certainly worth watching ,,
45,0.0,SIDEWAYS is the film that made pinot noir the in wine for a generation and reduced once chic merlot to near pariah status I still enjoy a nice merlot but I have to admit that I now know about and buy pinot noir which I did not do before I first saw SIDEWAYS One wonders if pinot noir vineyards had an investment in this film Hmmmm Paul Giamatti plays Miles a hyper twitchy would be novelist recently divorced and Thomas Haden Church plays his best friend Jack a laid back hunky second rate actor Both take a boys only wine tasting excursion together through the vineyards of California For Miles this is an opportunity perhaps to contemplate his failed marriage For Jack it is his last time to get laid before getting married Miles the nuerotic nerd is a serious student of wines and Jack the shallow stud is a serious student of women One wonders how these two complete opposites ever became best friends But putting convenient and somewhat strange screenplay logic aside Miles and Jack together find adventure romance and redemption on the road I have seen SIDEWAYS twice the second time I enjoyed it more than the first viewing It is a film that grows on you a character study and a film with some depth the perfect antidote to mindless thrillers The scene where Miles and a recently divorced acquaintance of Miles played by Virginia Madsen passionately discuss what they like about wine is worth the price of admission SIDEWAYS is one of the best films of the year or maybe the decade Rent it or buy it but enjoy it with a bottle of pinot noir ,,
46,0.0,Having barely seen an episode or two on PBS in my youth I really got into the series after seeing the 1997 US TV movie I quickly snatched up every VHS tape and found every other missing episode and unreleased story on bootleg videos to obsessively have every inch of existing Doctor Who known to man I preferred Jon Pertwee s Doc the best with Troughton and T Baker next No need to get into the original classic series so on with the new one br br Right from the start I really enjoy Eccleston s portrayal of the Doctor It seems he really did his homework and seems to have found just the right combination of wit and intellect that made so many previous doctors a success His quick tongue seems to keep up to the fast new pace of the show While the longer episode vintage shows had more time for character development and interaction in today s fast paced world of 32x fast forward speed DVD capability you can t have 4 to 6 part episodes and expect to keep people s attention to that one storyline It worked in the 70 s but certainly wouldn t work now br br Vintage Doctor Who always had great supporting casts and guest stars and the new series is no different Rose s boyfriend and mom keep up nicely to the pace and plotting of the show Simon Callow gives a great performance as Charles Dickens in the series 3rd episode br br Episode 1 Rose sweeps us back into the whirlwind world of Doctor Who that we all know and love It seems like it nearly skipped a beat since 1989 with only the surroundings and special effects being updated It also offers enough info to keep a new viewer interested Rose is very action packed much more than most vintage Who stories and I think it has to be in some way to cater to the thrill a minute new millenium that we are all now fully accustomed to br br I had seen some sneak preview photos of the Autons before the show aired and I thought they looked a little awkward and feared they might come across a bit cheesy in live action however they threw me for a loop after watching Rose as they looked incredibly lifelike and menacing Bravo for the special effects wizards who worked on them as they looked brilliant A superb opening episode to bring us all back into Who br br Ep 2 kept Eccleston s sharp tongue going and flew us into an alien space station complete with just about every new concoction of an alien species one can concoct Actually the oddest looking species was the human A murderous metallic set of spiders is unleashed on a group of interplanetary oglers wanting to witness the last moments of Earth The always fashionably late in saving the day Doctor has to come to Rose and everyone else s rescue br br Ep 3 takes us to familiar Who territory a period piece on planet Earth 1869 to be exact and Charles Dickens is giving a Christmas Eve performance of A Christmas Carol that gets rudely interrupted by a gas powered walking corpse The sets and costumes are superb and this 19th century Cardiff set story is a real treat br br Episodes 4 5 are the first two part storyline which deals with the Slitheen aliens invading Parliament It features some hilarious moments when the Slitheen attempt to wear their rubber suits that impersonate humans br br Ep 6 is what we ve all been waiting for The Dalek episode But alas it features only one but that s all it takes for a very strong episode involving an American collector of the future who happens to have found one remaining Dalek but doesn t realize how dangerous it really is The Doctor fully aware of Dalek aggression has to step in and set things straight with a little help from Rose br br Ep 7 The Long Game takes us into a satellite space station where people are not returning from certain floors of the station br br Ep 8 one of the strongest and certainly the most emotional of the series sees Rose wanting the Doctor to allow her to see the father she never knew however she does something the Doctor would never do and specifically asks her not to do interferes with time br br Episodes 9 10 is another two parter involves the Doctor and Rose in the middle of bomb ridden London circa 1941 Captain Jack Harkness is introduced and becomes a rival hero character for the Doctor br br Ep 11 involves the return of the Slitheen and their plan to destory Earth br br Ep 12 features a great spoof of reality shows with the Doctor stuck in the middle This episode also features the best cliffhanger of the new show Rose is kidnapped by the Daleks and the Doctor defiantly proclaims I m gonna blow every last stinkin one of ya out of the sky Something no previous doctor would have ever said it s a now classic quote and very characteristic of the new Who era and the new Doctor br br Episode 13 the final battle with the Daleks is the culmination of startling sci fi entertainment and a fine arguement for being the best season in the show s long and storied history It extremely disappointing that Eccleston is not returning for Season 2 That is a shame because his Doctor is extremely well played Hopefully David Tennant can fill his shoes nicely and I m sure the writing will be just as strong as series 1 br br These are going to be loaded with all the extras found in the UK release They initially released bare bones DVD s on Region 2 in 4 volumes which is how I got them as I had to have each new Who right away and I can t wait until May 1st when I will have the first of season 2 in my hands For now US fans unable to play or get a hold of Region 2 discs have the Sci Fi Channel airings and this new set out in July ,,
47,0.0,When I first saw COP back in 1988 I could not believe how tough and on the edge this action thriller was not to mention the film s total lack of respect for political correctness James Woods is brilliant and in rare form here Be warned Language action and attitudes are frank Characters are hardcore and flawed this includes the hero and nothing is censored for mainstream tastes br br If you re looking for a politically correct sissy movie like the forgettable PG 13 crap they make today where all content is watered down so that some conservative soccer mom in Utah can enjoy herself stay away This movie means business and does not pull any punches which is why I love it br br James Woods plays Lloyd Hopkins a hard boiled American police detective on the trail of a serial murderer who is victimizing women in Los Angeles The pursuit leads him through a world that has become his own natural habitat a nasty uncompromising world of crime drugs prostitution and male hustlers where innocence kills according to Hopkins and continued exposure corrupts br br Paradoxically this harsh world is also a world of love secret admirers romantic feminist poets and modern chivalry But these elements are woven underneath the tough exterior br br I don t want to say too much about this movie just this BUY IT AND WATCH IT Definitely recommeneded But it s only for cool guys who love the hardboiled tough stuff James Woods has never been better ,,
48,1.0,I was told by several people at work that this was the best horror movie that they had seen in a long while Based on their opinions I went and bought the special edition After viewing Saw I came to the conclusion that it was one of the silliest movies horror or otherwise that I had seen in quite some time Firstly it s not scary in the slightest Gory does not equal scary in my book Also there were several unintentionally funny scenes in the movie The silly mask that Jigsaw wears was just one thing that made me laugh If you re a connoiseur of horror movies as I am I would recommend Saw for a good laugh but nothing else I don t think I ll listen to the people I work with anymore ,,
49,1.0,I m a big fan of both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp and Danny Elfman But this movie is incredibly terrible Sure Johnny Depp s interpretation of Willy Wonka is very interesting and unique but this movie and its music is completely unmemorable and offputting ,,
50,0.0,Even though George Romero is credited with the br birth of the modern day zombie in 1968 it s real debut br can go all the way back to 1932 with White Zombie br featuring Bela Lugosi But I think what Romero br introduced that got him the credit was the zombie s br cannibalistic need of living parts be it flesh or brains br along with the disease factor of if you get bitten alive br you ll end up walking dead like them It also didn t br hurt to be one of the first films to have a multi racial br cast featuring an African American as group leader br which of course in 68 was pretty rare indeed Yeah br Night Of The Living Dead deserves this honor even if br technically it isn t quite true br br But it wasn t until almost ten years later Romero br really put the zombie in pop culture with the much br heralded Dawn Of The Dead in 1978 This film took br the trapped survivor scenerio of NOTLD up a notch by br putting in the more modern day setting of a typical br American pleasure the indoor shopping mall DOTD br while offering pretty much the same living character br design this time made the zombies more in number br appearance and graphic actions It was this film with br instead of it s shades of gray now bursting in bloody br color that put the Zombies on the map permanently br It s a great film that not only fleshes out the characters br at a good pace though at times it does seem a little br too detailed in that department but truly shown that br zombism has no cultural bounds Not only did the Americans br just eat up this new genre but on the opposite side of the world Europeans did so even more especially the film making members of Italy br br When Romero wanted his film to be presented over there br he enlisted the help of Italian filmaker Dario Argento to br re edit it for Italian audiences Argento slimed down bits br of comedy slower dialouge gave it a faster soundtrack and br changed it s name to Zombi This may have been one of the br most important effects this film ever could of have Not only was the film an even bigger success overseas but it inspired many br Italian filmmakers to continue what Romero started Before br Romero even thought of his 1985 third installment Day Of The Dead Italian director Lucio Fulci brought a year later his unofficial yet honored by Romero himself sequel called Zombi 2 This film showed what the worldwide Zombie outbreak was doing half a world away from that mall But this time the zombies were far more graphic and the gore and pacing were turned up by leaps bounds It was this film along with Dawn that gaveway for the Italian Zombie craze of the 1980 s Like how the Italians created their own successful version of the classic American Western ten years earlier they once again did it but with our Zombies What followed was a barrage of great Zombie films that never seemed to be carbon copies of Romero s then two classics but new ways of defining the genre Unfortunately by 85 with Day Of The Dead Romero seemed to be beaten at his own game by them with Day s lackluster audience response though over time it in itself has become the classic it deserves But all of this couldn t of happened without Romero his original update of Dawn Of The Dead It was that film that launched a thousand ships filled with the living dead br br And now a review of the 2004 DVD Ultimate Edition Anchor Bay release br br Without a doubt this is one of the most exhaustive releases any one film has ever received and it s completely deserved The film that started the Zombie craze that still lives to this day gets an amazing FOUR disc set that shows you every little piece of it s history and formations With this set you get THREE different versions of the film the US theatrical the extended Directors Cut and the rare Dario Argento European cut known as Zombi Each version has it s own merit and differences that never ever feels like release overkill All has been fully remastered to the hilt with different commentaries for each equally entertaining though it would have been nice to have an Argento one for the European cut No lack of movie presentation here you get it all br br Extras Wow you got them Documentaries commercials trailers stills photos home movies easter eggs Jeez this thing is packed In fact I couldn t even think of what it s missing All enclosed in a great box set with wonderful artwork and an errie front cover to boot C mon it even comes with a comic book for cryin out loud Now I know Anchor Bay Starz is known for double dipping their audience but it has never been as necessary as this one If you own any of their previous releases sell them and add it to the pot to get this Something of this quality to me has only been seen for a franchise not a single film release so you can tell just how impressive this set is So if you re a fan of any level to the original Dawn Of The Dead or the genre of Zombies itself your collection is NOT complete till you own this I personally have never given a DVD release a full 10 before and I feel once you get this you might do the same ,,
51,0.0,This movie must be seen twice in order to be fully appreciated The first viewing should be spent enjoying it for its eye popping special effects for its outrageous action for its killer industrial soundtrack and for the pleasure of watching Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss run around looking fabulous p The second viewing should be spent contemplating the questions The Matrix raises about our perception of reality It s hard to believe that such a slick glossy production starring Keanu Reeves conveys such deep mind boggling concepts but it does p The directing Wachowski brothers the guys responsible for the wonderfully outrageous Bound have been influenced heavily by other filmmakers authors and artists and they don t try to hide it in the least However rather than a blatant rip off this plays more like a reverent homage p Laurence Fishburne projects a powerful presence as the wise Morpheus although it often seems that he employed William Shatner as his dialogue coach Keanu Reeves is in his element The Matrix maximizes his strengths his ability to look completely dumbfounded and his unique physicality and minimizes his weaknesses just about everything else The role of Neo is tailor made for him The real standout in the cast however is Carrie Anne Moss as Trinity She is a real find and while she is stunning in a shiny black cat suit her purpose in this film is not simply ornamental She is responsible for at least half of this movie s excitement and she gives it its emotional heart p The Matrix is two movies in one One is a truly awesome action movie and the other is a deep meditation on the nature of reality It can be enjoyed equally on both levels but maybe not on first viewing See it at least twice p Stay tuned after the credits for 4 behind the scenes vignettes one of which shows Reeves in full wicked bad regalia perform a hilarious unintentional pratfall ,,
52,0.0,Quite a good recording for a live concert Minogue s band and tour staff have done an excellent job in recording the live concert They have captured the excitement of a live performance and Kylie at her best Showgirl Tour London DVD has a better selection of her hits ,,
53,0.0,One of my biggest concerns lately has been the lack of imagination in American feature films Everything seems to be a sequel of this or a remake of that I was really beginning to think that no one had an original story to tell anymore br br Thank goodness for the Closer Each story has a unique twist And the character of Brenda Leigh Johnson She is like most folks that are extremely talented she is stellar in that talent but has issues in the other facets of her life And the ensemble cast is excellent br br The only drawback to this show is that it is only on during the summer It is just torture to wait 9 months for it to be on again I just hope season 2 is released on dvd soon ,,
54,0.0,Despite being excessively popular I don t have much memories of watching a John Carpenter movie from start to finish either because I ve never watched it Assault on Precinct 13 or because they were so bad they quickly left my mind Escape from L A Vampires But since the Thing is an often mentioned recommendation when trying to watch a good Carpenter movie I thought I d check it out While it s not necessarily an amazing horror movie it s a bit effective if a bit familiar and a bit gruesome for gruesome s sake br br The film starts off in the Antartic wilderness with a group of men in a helicopter trying to shoot at a running dog A group of American scientists manage to take down the men and rescue the dog but turns out the dog was not who it appears to be and when investigating the other team s camp reveals a ship in the ice and a body shape in another block of ice which can imitate any form it wants the team has to figure out who s really who and try and stop the thing before it wipes out the whole crew or makes back to the mainland br br It s not the most familiar story of course although many films and even TV episodes such as the X Files Ice are described very much as being similar to this film What makes this film stand out is that there s a real sense of paranoia among the team and people overreacting and wondering who could be not who they are was well played But then again the characters don t really have much to do and besides certain actors I couldn t even remember the character s names or distinguish faces The film often has things that are unexplained or things that are merely implied so it s sort of a film that you kind of have to be serious in watching yet turn off your brain in sections br br Like a lot of horror you can either go for creepy atmosphere and tension to scare your audience or just think about totally disgusting stuff and call it a day To that end the Thing is sort of a combination of the 2 with the latter winning out by a nudge This is a film with some pretty vile imagery and I d recommend you don t eat before this one There are times when it gets memorable such as a dog or something to do with defribillators and a petrie dish but at times they look dated so guess it depends on whether you can blow past it and watch anyway br br The highlight of the special features is definately the commentary with Carpenter and star Kurt Russell as its funny and informative then there s also a documentary covering the film although I never bothered with the production photos as there s looooots of them But if you re into Carpenter s movies or a fan of horror check the film out ,,
55,0.0,Reading some of the negative reviews about this really outstanding film on Amazon had me slack jawed with wonder This movie is a slice of life superbly drawn Many scenes made me wince because I felt like I had already lived through them Who out there was actually looking for a morality play in an R rated movie that is quite obviously about DRINKING If you are thinking about writing a review of this film stop for a moment and think back to the scene in the movie where Miles and Jack are sitting under a rail road trestle discussing the rejection of Miles book The book Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole is mentioned as is the writer Charles Bukowski If you are not familiar with either that book or that writer don t write a review of this film because you obviously do not have enough information to fully understand it ,,
56,1.0,Once again a lot of hype for a very poorly mixed and edited film I don t know what it is about these films that always falls short with the music voice mixing The music is way too loud and the voices are too faint Not to mention the music sucks And what s up with the reverb These idiots used a mic on a camera about 50 feet away for the primary voice track in a large hall so you get all this heavy natural reverb making it even more difficult to hear what the presenter is saying Maybe a mic a little closer Idiots If there is any hidden knowledge being presented you ll have to wear headphones or constantly adjust the volume for the crappy music interludes to hear anything or watch it several times and take notes Why can t they pan the music to one side the voice to the other and hire an experienced mixing engineer for appropriate levels My suggestion to this production company Stick to the information and tone it down a bit on the unnecessary bells and whistles and consider mic placement next time Frankly most of us just want to hear the presenter not be subjected to a bunch of annoying heavy metal music and cheap transition effects Are these guys trying to promote their friends bands Just doesn t mesh br br This kind of low quality could be forgivable 20 years ago but with access to average technology pre installed on most computers today it is criminal ,,
57,0.0,This film while overlooked by critics deserves to be recognized as one of the greatest epics and biographies of all time While some may be drawn away by the 3 hrs time this movie will keep you interested and deeply involved The portrayal of Gandhi was done beautifully by Kingsley who gave this epic a base for acting I cannot reccomend this movie enough ,,

66,1.0,I enjoyed the first 45 minutes of this film It made me interested enough to want to keep watching It really starts falling apart though in the last half hour it simply makes no sense The scares come cheap lots of lame boo moments and the whole ghost angle is poorly conceived and not particularly compelling It s a shame ,,

72,0.0,Respectfully I must disagree with the previous poster concerning the transfer quality of this Blu ray br br I have not seen the Jane Doe Edition however coming from the 1998 Widescreen DVD release the improvement in detail and clarity on this Blu ray is nothing short of PHENOMENAL br br This transfer is reminiscent of CDs made from analog recordings you know the CDs which have that standard disclaimer that CD audio is so detailed it can reveal limitations in the analog source tape Ditto for this Blu ray this is perhaps the most true to the film source video transfer I ve yet to see on a Blu ray and I ve see a lot of em So any grain or coarse texture you see IMHO would be relics from the original film And while I m no expert isn t it more logical that the presence of grain would indicate a relative LACK of video processing After all processing would be done to smooth out the texture and get rid of the grain not the reverse no br br So yeah there s some grain in the dark shots and the close up head shots give a lot of shine off the edges of the hairstyles But that s because you re seeing the original film in all its imperfect glory The colors are beautifully natural almost subdued in keeping with a 1985 film none of the greenish tinge put there on purpose in the Matrix or the new Bourne films And most shots are incredibly detailed and natural looking For example you can see every wave and strand of hair in Gail Stanwyk s bountiful 80s hairstyle and the edge of the haircap is clearly visible on Fletch s forehead in his roller skating mystic scenes br br I can t comment on the sound separation as my speakers are not hooked up to my A V receiver at the moment but everything DID sound crystal clear through my Sennheiser wireless headphones with great bass ,,
73,0.0,This movie may not be perfect in all aspects but it is full of sweet and heart breaking moments that keep you rooting for its many underdogs all the way even the harsh and jaded main character Arlen The chemistry between the actors is flawless without exception The ending is satisfying in that it doesn t feel the need to tie up all the loose ends and it leaves you wanting more I have heard it compared to As Good as it Gets but I prefer this version While it lacks the glossy main stream production qualities of AGAIG it makes up for it in its every day heroes that are much more relatable ,,
74,0.0,For starters if you have not seen the Clone Wars movie you might want to start with it before getting this set The movie sets up a lot of the basis behind new characters involved in this series such as Anakan Skywalker s Padawan Ahsoka Tano and Count Dookus Apprentice or assassin Asajj Ventress These two characters will be involved with many of the tales without any history provided short of the movie Now on to the series br br When I first played it I was not completely engulfed into it like a Star Wars movie but once I got adjusted to the animation and the storyline picked up I was hooked It is as action Packed as the Star Wars films And although it might not have exactly the same actors who played in the movies voicing their character the voice over actors are great and almost sound like the actor who originally played each part The only time I really noticed it was when Count Dooku emerged You can tell that this is not Christopher Lee voicing the character Not that it does not sound like Christopher Lee it is just that the voice over actor is actually better at playing this part than Lee The plot line of most episodes are well written and will please most Star Wars fans Even those who call themselves Trekkers br br The case this set comes in is as unique as the show itself It is not a standard plastic case with a leaflet or two thrown inside It is a Book that has two sturdy holders on each hardback book cover to hold your dvds in place As a bonus it includes a 66 page book in the center featuring concept drawings of the show and other items of interest used in the development of this show Overall 4 5 stars for the show 5 stars for packaging and 5 stars for the extras br br Overall this set is well worth the price and makes an excellent show to watch Can t wait to get the second season ,,
75,0.0,YES i like the movie a lot br i think the way Gaspard tries to compare with Anthony Hopkins is as good as anyone could do To step in his shoes would never be easy br Me as a German was not really suprised that we are the one to blame again br But i have to say that you can understand this incredible interesting character better when you watch his rising br I think the movie causes a lot of tension till the end br what i find a little bit weird was the chinese influence at that time in France br But its still a very good movie for its genre ,,
76,0.0,But this movie deserves a better review br br First the Bad br br Dirty Love is NOT everyone s cup of tea as many previous reviews indicate There are scenes that are extraordinarily vivid in their bawdy humor Absolutely not for kids Many people will simply consider the humor to be profane or idiotic or both This is also a low budget production The premise is a pedestrian Girl Looking For Mister Right theme with a happy ending br br Now the Good br br If bawdy humor is your thing this movie has some hilarious moments Many of them In fact some of the writing is inspired in it s eye opening depictions of the excitement and misery in the modern dating scene Jenny McCarthy wrote the script it reflects her sense of humor and is thus a very personal heartfelt work as well br br Despite the well worn subject matter McCarthy s script is very funny Her depiction of the creepy guys she meets are wonderfully over the top Her goofy vain air heady but ultimately loyal and caring friends are quite well played by Carmen Electra and Kam Heskin Who knew Electra could act br br There are many tender moments that are truly sweet Yet some of these scenes take dramatic turns into the gutter in ways that are truly jarring I found these sudden changes as funny as they were intended to be but it takes a special sense of humor to appreciate the sweet moments AND laugh at the completely over the top way Jenny s period arrives in vivid color right in the middle of the supermarket br br The real revelation here though is McCarthy herself Her performance is quite funny and she s a skilled actress with real ability in physical comedy She s wearing her heart on her sleeve in this movie You really can see how thoughtful and sensitive she is but also get a strong understanding of the crazy and likely close to her own experiences horrific world of finding the right guy in LA Totally willing to subject herself to the most outrageous situations she literally puts her body out there for all to see sometimes in ways that will make you cringe sometimes to admire her beauty inside and out It s her film and it s a good one br br I really enjoyed it br br Editing this several months later br br OK 4 stars is just too high a rating all things considered 3 is more appropriate but that still warrants a good rating for this movie with some unexpectedly gutsy humor ,,
77,0.0,Gillo Pontecorvo who also made The Battle of Algiers gives us the only kind of movie that treats the Holocaust respectfully and responsibly in order to survive a Jewish girl almost sells her soul by assuming another person s identity and becoming a concentration camp guard Excellent cinematography and authentic moral complexity ,,
78,0.0,The cast is very good Without giving away too much the plot primarily centers around a successful professional woman Julianne Moore who suspects her College Professor Husband Liam Neeson of cheating The game is afoot albeit in a dysfunctional erotica way when the wife chooses to use amanda seyfried to confirm or deny the wife s suspisicons What follows is for you the viewer to absorb and deduce as to what will happen next This is what makes this flick interesting Of course from this guy s perspective it doesn t hurt that the two main female leads are very attractive This is an enjoyable off the beaten path film that is well worth the amazon price Not too disturbing and with many common issues experienced or at least pondered by couples in today s society Finally the ending definately has an unexpected twist and leaves you thinking what exactly did the wife learn about this experience ,,
79,0.0,The Bourne movies are intelligent action flicks that my husband loves to watch over and over I ordered this set and now he can pull them out whenever he s in the mood for something good to watch instead of channel surfing They came so fast after I ordered them too I was impressed ,,
80,0.0,My name is Bill W is a production coherent to its message like the group theraphy of the Anonimous Alcoholics it is simple and efficient The system was the result of an open and fair partnership of two very determined guys Bob Smith and Bill Wilson The script of the movie together with art direction and actor s performance succeed to keep the focus on the main message the only way to fight alcohol is to avoid drinking for the next 24 hours For this reason it is a brilliant achievement the big star is the solidarity there are no celebrities but common people with drinking problems that share their experience ,,
81,0.0,This is a wonderful romantic comedy but the best part about this movie is that it is not the typical romantic comedy br br There are abundant character development as well as many twists and turns of character and storyline You will not get the simply girl meets boy fall in love Under the Tuscan Sun explores the complexity of life and tries to capture the intricacies of relationships as well as focuses on a fundamental message of home It s realistic without sacraficing a happy ending and ironically a great post break up movie usually romantic drama comedies are not br br Under the Tuscan Sun is great fun very engaging and has gorgeous scenery to boot Highly recommend ,,

83,0.0,At long last after all the dashed hopes and anxieties we finally have a remastered studio print of the best Elvis comedy ever GIRL HAPPY This movie had wonderful casting no one else could come close to Harold J Stone s performance as Big Frank He was so intimidating all through the movie and turns into an old softie by films end Fabrizio Mioni from 1959 s Hercules w Steve Reeves as the Italian exchange student who must have been the original marine biology major as long as it was female biology Gary Crosby and his various attempts at German and Yiddish accents explaining why he can t be trusted to protect Shelly Fabares I m too well trained the other way Jackie Coogan Uncle Fester as Ft Lauderdale police Sgt Benson who arrests all the college kids John Fiedler as the motel manager NO Boys in the Room br MaryAnn Mobley never more sexy and alluring as Deena perpetually frustrated with Elvis passion interruptus she was drop dead gorgeous in that black and white print dress showing why she won the Miss America Crown Shelley Fabares in her best of three co starring roles opposite Elvis with that adorably cute little flip hairdo and peachy sweet face not to mention a great figure as evidenced in the She s Evil number dancing around Elvis in that sexy outfit Eat your heart out Britney and finally The King himself giving as always 200 of himself for the sake of his loyal fans Let s face it in 1965 the only way you were going to get to see Elvis was on a movie screen He knew this and did the best he could with the material presented But in this film it all clicks the story the location the characters and the songs Walt Disney said musical numbers in a movie should always support and advance the plot and all the songs in Girl Happy meet this requirement handily One of the best musical scenes is when Elvis and guys and Shelley and girls are driving down to Florida in their convertibles all color coordinated singing Spring Fever alternating verses You can see how much fun they were having with this scene just watch the antics of Elvis Gary Jimmy Hawkins of It s A Wonderful Life fame and Joby Baker in that cramped car They are constantly laughing and joking around Honorable mention to Peter Brooks Brentwood Von Durgenfeld BVD and Nita Talbot Sunny Daze the stripper for great comic support I guarantee if you watch this movie you will have fun fun fun and want to watch it again and again I just can t fathom why it took all this time to release it on DVD All I can say is It Was Worth the Wait ,,
